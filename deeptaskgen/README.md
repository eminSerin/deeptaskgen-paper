## DeepTaskGen

PyTorch implementation of DeepTaskGen, a convolutional neural network designed to predict individual task contrasts from voxel-to-ROI resting state connectomes. This model is an adaptation of BrainSurfCNN (Ngo et al., 2021) and includes three distinct architectures: UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015), Residual-UNet (Zhang et al., 2018), and VNet (Milletari et al., 2016).

**Please note** that this project is currently in the **development phase** and may not be fully functional. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
